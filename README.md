# jQuery Lite

jQuery is used for making AJAX requests, manipulating the DOM, and handling events in the browser.

Utilizing the native DOM API built into all browsers, this project reveals how little of jQuery one may actually need.

## Functionality

- jQuery lite constructor function in the window (`$l`)
- `$l.extend` to extend multiple objects
- `$l.ajax` to make basic AJAX requests
- Common manipulations of the DOM
- Event handling (`$.on` and `$.off`), although without event delegation

## Usage

To use, load the `jquery_lite.js` file in the `<head>` of your HTML:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/jquery_lite.js"></script>
```
